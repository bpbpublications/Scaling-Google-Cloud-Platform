# Scaling Google Cloud Platform

Managing Real-world Production-grade Challenges at Scale

This is the repository for [Edge Computing with Python

## About the Book
‘Scaling Google Cloud Platform’ equips developers with the know-how to get the most out of its services in storage, serverless computing, networking, infrastructure monitoring, and other IT tasks. This book explains the fundamentals of cloud scaling, including Cloud Elasticity, creating cloud workloads, and selecting the appropriate cloud scaling key performance indicators (KPIs).
 
The book explains the sections of GCP resources that can be scaled, as well as their architecture and internals, and best practices for using these components in an operational setting in detail. The book also discusses scaling techniques such as predictive scaling, auto-scaling, and manual scaling. This book includes real-world examples illustrating how to scale many Google Cloud services, including the compute engine, GKE, VMWare Engine, Cloud Function, Cloud Run, App Engine, BigTable, Spanner, Composer, Dataproc, and Dataflow.
 
At the end of the book, the author delves into the two most common architectures—Microservices and Bigdata to examine how you can perform reliability engineering for them on GCP.
